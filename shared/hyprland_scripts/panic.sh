# FoxML Panic Button
# Instantly locks down the machine, wipes sensitive memory, and stops active engines.
#
# Process kills are scoped by exact binary name (-x) and per-pid cwd
# inspection so we don't nuke unrelated processes that happen to share
# a name (e.g. someone else's `engine` binary, or an nvim editing a
# poem). Generic substring pkill is intentionally avoided.

# 1. Clipboard wipe — best-effort across the common providers.
#
# Order matters here. cliphist uses bbolt for its on-disk store
# (~/.cache/cliphist/db); bbolt holds an exclusive file lock while
# the cliphist daemon is alive, so:
#   - rm on a locked file may fail silently
#   - even if rm succeeds, the running daemon's in-memory cache will
#     write back to a freshly-recreated db on the next clipboard event,
#     restoring the very entries we're trying to wipe.
#
# Correct sequence:
#   a) cliphist wipe        (clear daemon's in-memory state via API)
#   b) kill the wl-paste/cliphist daemons (release the bbolt lock + stop
#      future writes)
#   c) shred + rm the db file (now safely lockless; shred overwrites
#      blocks before unlink so the data isn't recoverable from the
#      filesystem)
#   d) wl-copy clear (covers the live Wayland clipboard buffer)
