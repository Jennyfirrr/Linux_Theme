All notable changes to the Fox ML theme.

## 2026-03-13

### Neovim - Syntax Color Refinement & Window Fixes
- Improved syntax color differentiation: types (peach italic), functions (peach), variables (lavender), parameters (cyan), members (soft pink), operators (pink), keywords (pink bold)
- Updated LSP semantic token highlights to match treesitter palette — fixes colors shifting 1-2 seconds after file open when clangd attaches
- Added `ColorScheme` autocmd to re-apply FoxML theme after plugin/treesitter loads
- Fixed which-key popup transparency — added `WhichKeyNormal` highlight group with solid `bg_deep` background
- Set inactive window background to solid `bg` — provides visual distinction from active (transparent) window
- Removed `tint.nvim` plugin (inactive window dimming)
- Updated README screenshots (nvim 3-pane layout + avante sidebar)

### Neovim - Custom FoxML Colorscheme (Tokyo Night removed)
- Replaced `folke/tokyonight.nvim` dependency with a fully self-contained FoxML colorscheme — all highlights now live in `apply_foxml_theme()` inside init.lua
- Added `local P = { ... }` palette table (32 colors) as single source of truth — all hex values reference `P.xxx` instead of repeating strings
- Added built-in Vim syntax groups (~35): Comment, String, Function, Keyword, Type, Statement, PreProc, Special, etc.
- Added full diagnostics coverage (~18): Error/Warn/Info/Hint with undercurl underlines, virtual text, and sign variants
- Added Treesitter highlight groups (~55): all @function, @keyword, @string, @constant, @markup, @tag families
- Added LSP semantic token groups (~21): @lsp.type.class, @lsp.type.function, @lsp.mod.deprecated, etc.
- Added Diff & Spell groups (8): DiffAdd/Change/Delete/Text, SpellBad/Cap/Rare/Local with undercurl
- Added terminal ANSI colors (16): vim.g.terminal_color_0 through _15 mapped to FoxML palette
- Registered as proper colorscheme via `vim.g.colors_name = "foxml"`
- Converted all plugin opts (bufferline, notify, scrollbar, colorful-winsep, lualine) from hardcoded hex to `P.xxx` references
- Removed tokyonight from lazy-lock.json
- Changed default fg from cold white `#f5f5f7` to warm coffee cream `#d5c4b0`
- Fixed sidebar transparency — neo-tree, Avante, Trouble, and aerial panels now get solid `bg_deep` backgrounds via `NormalSidebar` + FileType autocmd (prevents terminal opacity bleeding through)
- Removed transparent gap between splits — WinSeparator and VertSplit use solid `bg_deep` on both fg/bg, fillchars vert changed to space
- Removed global `winblend = 15` (was making all floats semi-transparent); kept `pumblend = 15` for popup menu only
- Improved Avante edit (`<leader>ae`) UX — removed Visual blend for solid selection highlight, brighter prompt input background, bolder inline hints

### Neovim - Avante & Copilot QoL
- Set `auto_add_current_file = false` — visual selections now send only the selected code to Copilot, not the entire file
- Added `<leader>ae` — edit selection in-place with Avante (visual mode)
- Added `<leader>ar` — refresh Avante response
- Added `<leader>aS` — stop Avante generation
- Enabled `auto_apply_diff_after_generation` — diffs apply automatically after Avante responds
- Show model name in Avante sidebar header
- Bumped Avante history token limit to 8192 for longer conversations
- Added 150ms debounce to Copilot suggestions to reduce keystroke lag
- Disabled Copilot ghost text in Avante input/sidebar buffers
- Added Copilot status indicator in lualine (green = ready, yellow = thinking, red = error)
- Fixed `vim.tbl_filter` deprecation warnings → `vim.iter():filter():totable()` (nvim 0.11+)
- Suppressed `vim.lsp.buf_get_clients` deprecation from project.nvim/telescope (upstream issue)
- Full FoxML theme for all Avante highlights — sidebar, titles, buttons, spinners, conflict markers, task status, thinking indicator
- Themed missing core UI groups: PmenuSbar/Thumb, CurSearch, Folded, TabLine, StatusLine, WildMenu, Title, Directory, Question, SpecialKey, NonText, Conceal
- Themed noice message split window and :messages highlights (MsgArea, WarningMsg, ErrorMsg, ModeMsg, MoreMsg)

## 2026-03-12

### Neovim - Visual Polish (Round 2)
- Added **noice.nvim** — floating cmdline popup, search popup, and message routing (replaces bottom cmdline)
- Added **nvim-notify** — animated notification popups with FoxML-themed borders
- Added **nvim-colorizer** — renders hex colors inline with their actual color
- Added **rainbow-delimiters.nvim** — colors nested brackets/parens in rotating FoxML palette (peach → pink → mint → yellow → cyan → red)
- Added **colorful-winsep.nvim** — highlights active window border in peach when using splits
- Added **nvim-scrollbar** + **nvim-hlslens** — scrollbar showing diagnostics, git changes, and search hits; search match counter overlay
- Added **tint.nvim** — subtly dims inactive splits so focused window stands out
- Full FoxML palette highlights for all new plugins (noice, notify, rainbow delimiters, scrollbar, hlslens)
- Disabled colorizer for C/C++/H files — hex constants like `0xFFFFFFFF` no longer get painted as literal colors
- Made number/hex literals bold warm yellow for better glow against dark background
- Backed up pre-polish config as `init.lua.bak`

### Neovim - Visual Polish
- Custom FoxML lualine theme — peach normal, mint insert, pink visual, red replace, yellow command
- Replaced encoding/fileformat statusline clutter with active LSP server name
- Enabled native smooth scrolling (`smoothscroll`)
- Enabled cursorline highlight and guicursor (block/beam/blink)
- Added warm-tinted window separator using `bg_highlight`
- Fixed deprecated `vim.loop` → `vim.uv` calls

### Removed FoxML Paper Theme
- Removed WIP light theme (FoxML Paper) — keeping only FoxML Classic
- Cleaned up README references to Paper

### Neovim - Window & Buffer Keybind Fixes
- `Space q` is now smart — won't leave neo-tree filling the whole screen when closing the last file window
- `Space bd` no longer silently fails on empty/unnamed buffers
- Added `Space o` to unsplit (close all other windows, keep current)

### Multi-Theme Hub Restructure
- Converted from single-theme repo to **multi-theme hub** with template-based rendering
- All 23+ app configs are now **templates** with `{{COLOR}}` placeholders — one set of configs, any number of themes
- Each theme is just a `palette.sh` file defining ~60 color variables; adding a new theme = writing one file
- New render engine (`render.sh`) handles hex, RGB decomposition, ANSI codes, and metadata substitution
- New `mappings.sh` with source→destination mappings and special handlers (Firefox, Cursor, Spicetify, Bat, Hyprland)
- New `swap.sh` — theme swapper with 24-bit truecolor color swatches in terminal
- Shared (non-color) files split into `shared/` directory
- Updated install.sh and update.sh to work with the template system
- Reverse rendering: `update.sh` pulls system configs back into templates by replacing colors with placeholders

### Docs

- Disabled snacks.nvim notifier
- Lazy-loaded 15+ plugins (copilot, vimtex, neotest, diffview, undotree, trouble, spectre, aerial, dap, cmake-tools, overseer, toggleterm, project.nvim)
- Added **neo-tree.nvim** — file tree sidebar (`Space e`)
- Added **bufferline.nvim** — buffer tabs at top (`Shift+H/L` to cycle, `Space bd` to close)
- Added window management keybinds (`Space v/s` for splits, `Ctrl+Arrow` to resize)
- Moved neotest setup into lazy config function
- Removed all `Noice*` highlight groups, added `NeoTree*` highlights in Fox ML palette
- Silenced project.nvim CWD notifications

### Neovim - QoL Improvements
- `Ctrl+h/j/k/l` to navigate splits directly
- `Alt+j/k` in visual mode to move lines up/down
- `Ctrl+d/u` and `n/N` keep cursor centered
- `Esc` clears search highlights and exits terminal mode
- Visual mode `<`/`>` indent without losing selection
- `Space q` to close window
- Auto yank highlight (200ms flash)
