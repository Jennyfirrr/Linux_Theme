# tests/roundtrip.sh — verifies install→update is a no-op on templates/.
#
# What it checks: render templates with a theme, deploy to live config,
# pull live config back into templates, and assert templates/ is unchanged.
# A drift means render.sh and update.sh aren't perfect inverses, or a
# templated file in shared/ has logic the templates/ haven't caught up
# with (I-04 violation).
#
# Run on a configured machine. Side effect: rewrites your live config
# from the current templates (with backups under ~/.theme_backups/).
#
# Usage: ./tests/roundtrip.sh [theme-name]
